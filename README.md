# Office365RollOut
Steps taken for deploying Office 365 to the company

First, you need to configure the settings you want from https://config.office.com/deploymentsettings .
  I included my .xml files to show the changes I made. My company wanted to lock down OneDrive until after we migrated our fileserver to the cloud.

Next, you will need to download and configure your setup.exe file. 
  Mine is titled Cmd4O365AppsCustomTool.txt for your reference. I used https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/deploy-microsoft-365-apps-local-source which is a great resource.
